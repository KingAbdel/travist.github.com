{% img left http://www.sencha.com/img/sencha-large.png Sencha Touch %} Yesterday, I gave a presentation
to the Drupal Dallas Group over a technology that I have been really interested in lately called
[Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch).  Basically, this technology allows you to
create a mobile application using an MVC web application framework based off of ExtJS.  What is
even more exciting is when you pair this technology with the [Drupal CMS](http://drupal.org) as a backend service
for this mobile framework.  The result is something very exciting.
