{% img left http://weedygarden.net/images/2013/octopress.png Octopress %} Today I am launching my website using a new technology that REALLY excites me.  For
starters, this blog is built using the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) system, which is basically a static
website generator but allows you to install plugins, create layouts, as well as many
other features that keep you from repeating yourself when building a website (DRY).

In addition to Jekyll, this blog is built using a technology that sits on top of
Jekyll called [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), which simply provides a framework for
building technology blogs... or in other words, it is a blogging engine for Nerds.  Amazing stuff
and I hope this enables me to easily add my thoughts from the past and the future.

And then finally, I cannot forget [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). I am in love
with Github and when they introduced this capability, it just solidified my allegiance to
this company. If you haven't had a chance to see this technology, then I highly recommend
checking it out.
