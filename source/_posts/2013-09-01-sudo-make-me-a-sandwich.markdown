So, I have been preparing for my presentation that I will be giving to the <a href="http://events.jquery.org/2013/austin/#program">jQuery
Conference</a>, where I will be talking about automating and testing the web using
a combination of jQuery, Node.js, and Phantom.js.  This presentation will primarily go
over a new library that I wrote called <a href="https://github.com/travist/jquery.go.js">jQuery.go.js</a>, which
takes the jQuery interface and brings it into Node.js for the sole purpose of web
automation and testing using the Phantom.js headless browser.  It is a project that I am very
happy with so when you get a chance, check it out and give me your feedback...

But what REALLY excites me about this presentation is the project I came up with that demonstrates
the power of these three JavaScript technologies combined.  What I basically created was a command line
application that allows you to order a sandwich from Jimmy John's website.  This should
strike a chord with many geeks out there, since there is a legendary XKCD comic which I
basically made real with this project...

So, without further adieu, I give you <a href="https://github.com/travist/makemeasandwich.js">MakeMeASandwich.js</a>!
<!-- more -->

I provide some instructions on how to install and use this library <a href="https://github.com/travist/makemeasandwich.js">on the project page</a>...

Also, I purposefully left my favorite sandwich and work address in the config.json if anyone decides they would like to say thanks...  ;)

Ping me in IRC @ #drupal-dallas (travist) before you do it though...

Enjoy!
